        <p>EVENT TERM: The CTF competition (“Contest”) begins at 03:00:00 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) Zone in the United States on 9/15/2017 and ends at 02:59:59 P.M. EDT on 9/16/2016 (“Contest Period”). Entrants are responsible for determining the corresponding time zone in their respective jurisdictions.</p>

        <p>SPONSOR: The MITRE Corporation is the sponsor of this Contest ("MITRE").</p>

        <p>COST:  No purchase necessary to enter or win. Void where prohibited.</p>

        <p>ELIGIBILITY: The Contest is open to individuals who have registered at "mitrestemctf.org", and are hereby known as Contestants.  A Contestant is eligible for Prizes if they are a current high school or undergraduate college student within the United States and are a United States Citizen.  Void where prohibited.  All federal, state and local laws and regulations apply. MITRE reserves the right to verify eligibility and to adjudicate on any dispute at any time.  On a pre-coordinated and pre-approved basis, as part of cyber training, this competition is also open to professional and government participants to participate for experience without being eligible for winning prizes, scholarships and internships.  Professional and Government representatives interested in participating in this manner should contact the MITRE CTF organizers for consideration and approval.  MITRE reserves the right to consider and approve such requests.</p>

        <p>HOW TO ENTER: Eligible participants may enter registering at “mitrestemctf.org” and completing the tasks as detailed on the site. Participants may enter only once. Participants will work in teams with a maximum of 5 Contestants per team.</p>

        <p>RULES: Flag sharing across teams is not permitted and will result in immediate disqualification. Teams may not do anything to diminish the competition experience for other participants on the system. Participants will not harass, intimidate and/or threaten each other or the competition judges.</p>

        <p>Entries are void if they are in whole or in part illegible, incomplete, damaged, irregular, altered, counterfeit, produced in error, forged, mechanically reproduced or obtained through fraud or theft. By entering you agree to be bound by these Official Rules and that all decisions of MITRE are final.</p>

        <p>Contestants are referred to the Competition Rules and Etiquette Overview for additional rules and etiquette to be followed during the competition.</p>

        <p>JUDGING: There is a scoreboard where points are assigned based on challenges being completed - there is no subjective judging of the contest. It will be purely based on score achieved, and in case of ties, first to reach those points will be the deciding factor ("Timestamp"). In the event of an identical Timestamp between Teams, Team names sorted in ascending order will be used.</p>

        <p>Within 24 hours of the completion of the CTF competition, the potential winner(s) will be selected and notified by email. If a potential winner does not respond to the notification attempt within 3 days from the first notification attempt, then such potential winner will be disqualified and an alternate potential winner will be selected from among all eligible entries received based on the judging criteria described herein.  Within two weeks after the completion of the CTF competition, the results will be made final once all winning team(s) have been verified for eligibility.  In the event that no entries are received or team(s) cannot be verified for eligibility, no prize will be awarded. Determinations of judges are final and binding.</p>

        <p>PRIVACY: MITRE will be collecting personal data about participants when they register and enter the Contest. MITRE will treat this data in accordance with its privacy policy, located at https://www.MITRE.org/privacy-policy.</p>

        <p>PRIZE: First place (1) winners from each division will be considered for winning prizes, scholarships and internships.  Prizes may be subject to terms, restrictions and conditions imposed by MITRE.  Participation in a MITRE or Industry partner cyber internship program is subject to an interviewing process and based on current business needs.  MITRE and its affiliates, subsidiaries and related companies, or their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents will not be liable for unsuccessful efforts to notify a winner. The prize will be delivered on the day of the drawing. No prize transfer, assignment or substitution by winner permitted except at Sponsor’s sole discretion. If the prize becomes unavailable, Sponsor reserves the right to substitute a prize of equal or greater value. All federal, state and local taxes, fees and surcharges on prizes are the sole responsibility of the winner. If the potential winner declines the prize, does not respond to the prize notification, fails to claim the prize, is unavailable for prize fulfillment, fails to abide by the Official Rules, or is ineligible, MITRE may select an alternate winner from all remaining eligible entries.  While this competition is open to professional and government participants as part of cyber training, only eligible high school and college teams will be considered for winning prizes, scholarships and internships.</p>
