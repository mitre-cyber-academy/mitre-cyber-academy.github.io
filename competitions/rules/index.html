        <p><b><u>Rules</u></b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Absolutely no flag sharing! (Why help your competitors?)</li>
            <li>You may not do <b>anything</b> to diminish the competition experience for other players on the system; if you are worried that you might break something, ask an operator in IRC (with a private message) for clarification. We love creativity, just clear it with us first.</li>
            <li>Foul play will not be tolerated (first offense is a warning, second offense is a 10-50 point deduction and third offense is a disqualification)
            <li>No bullying. This includes harassment, intimidation and threats.</li>
            <li>Operator decisions are final</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b><u>Etiquette</u></b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keep it clean in IRC and MPAA G-rated conversations, please</li>
            <li>Remember that operators in IRC channel are running the game</li>
            <li>Be a good sport throughout the competition</li>
        </ul>
