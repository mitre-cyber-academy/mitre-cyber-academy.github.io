                <h2>2020 Award Ceremony</h2>
                <p>
                  The current schedule for the 2020 Award Ceremony is posted below.
                  The ceremony will take place on Zoom, however, we will be airing the pre-recorded student presentations on <a href="https://twitch.tv/ectf">https://twitch.tv/ectf</a>.
                  We recommend that attendees keep both the Zoom call and the twitch stream running in separate tabs throughout the day as only one will be "live" at a time.
                  Following each presentation will be a 5 minute Q&A block with the team on Zoom.
                  We will also have two networking blocks which provide the opportunity to ask any additional questions, as well as a chance to network with other participants and the MITRE and Riverside Research staff.

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    MITRE's eCTF (<b>embedded</b> capture-the-flag) is an embedded security competition that puts participants through the experience of trying to create a secure system and then learning from their mistakes. The main target is a real <b>physical</b> embedded device, which opens the scope of the challenge to include physical/proximal access attacks.  The eCTF is a two-phase competition with attack and defense components.  In the first phase, competitors design and implement a secure system based on a set of challenge requirements.  The second phase involves analyzing and attacking the other teams’ designs. 
                </p>

                <hr>
                <h2>FAQ</h2>    
                <h5> How is this different from other Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions?</h5>
                <p>
                    The eCTF is unique in two major ways. First, the focus is on securing embedded systems, which present an entirely new set of challenges and security issues that are not currently covered by traditional “online” CTFs. Second, this event balances offense and defense by including a significant secure-design phase in addition to an attack phase. This competition will help you develop practical skills that can be applied securing critical systems, such as medical devices, smart grids, IoT devices, and mobile devices.
                <p>
                <h5>How does it work?</h5>
                <p>This event puts competitors through the exercise of trying to create a secure system and then learning from their mistakes. The main target is a real physical embedded device, opening the challenge to include physical/proximal access attacks.</p>
                
                <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
                    <p>
                    <b>Secure Design</b> &#9472; Teams design a secure system that meets all the challenge requirements.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <b>Handoff</b> &#9472; MITRE verifies that each submitted system has met all functional requirements. MITRE posts designs for all teams to evaluate during the attack phase.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                    <b>Attack</b> &#9472; Teams perform security evaluations of opposing teams’ systems and request provisionedchips for vulnerable systems. Points are awarded for flags retrieved from successful attacks.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h5>What is this year’s challenge?</h5>
                <p>
                    Teams will design a secure audio digital rights management (DRM) module for a next-generation multimedia player on the Digilent Cora Z7. The system must be secure to prevent users from playing pirated music, support region locking, and prevent the creation of cloned bootleg players.
                </p>

                <h5>Who can participate?</h5>
                <p>
                    Anyone! Students at all academic levels are welcome to participate. Team sizes are unlimited (although a minimum of 4 students is recommended). Sponsorship of a faculty member is preferred.
                </p>

                <h5>Do I need to travel for the competition?</h5>
                <p>
                    The competition can be done 100% remotely. MITRE will ship all required hardware to the teams at the start of the competition and development can be done directly on your college campus. Once teams have a completed design, they submit the code to MITRE for testing and MITRE will ensure that all challenge requirements are met. Once this verification process is completed, the source code and compiled binaries will be provided to all of the attacking teams.
                </p>
                <p>Once the competition concludes, MITRE hosts an award ceremony where teams are invited to share in their accomplishments, meet participants from other schools, interact with MITRE staff, and see the final standings revealed!</p>

                <h5>Can I earn college credits?</h5>
                <p>
                    Work with your professor(s) / faculty advisor to determine how to earn credit at your institution. Most students can earn college credit hours. Remember that this is a significant time commitment, typically commensurate with the credit hours you may receive.
                </p>

                <h5>What is provided by MITRE to help?</h5>
                <p>
                    MITRE provides teams with a reference implementation, embedded hardware, and technical guidance throughout the competition.
                </p>

                <h5>Are there awards?</h5>
                <p>
                    Winning teams receive a cash prize, publicity from MITRE, and typically earn accolades from their university as well. Students have used their participation in eCTF to build resumes, present at conferences, and open the door to valuable internship and career opportunities, including engineering positions at MITRE.
                </p>
